I'm still surprised by how many guitars come through the shop that are fakes. I recently let a fellow know his new Ibanez Jem was worth less than half what he thought as it was a knockoff.

Many of these have been decent playing and sounding with a little TLC but buyer beware. Feel free to ring me if you're unsure about an instrument. Cheers everyone.
